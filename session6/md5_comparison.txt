MD5 of the files are identical

da5c61e1edc0f18337e46418e48c1290  files_session6/Linux version/erase
da5c61e1edc0f18337e46418e48c1290  files_session6/Linux version/hello

It is obvious that the both files have the same MD5 and it is an indication that MD5 is broken
and is useless and that the evil file can be downloaded and confirmed as the good file.
