Entropy = 5.274056 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 16383 byte file by 34 percent.

Chi square distribution for 16383 samples is 136025.29, and randomly
would exceed this value less than 0.01 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 88.7284 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 4.000000000 (error 27.32 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.375237 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
