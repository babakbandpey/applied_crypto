I found the solution to this question  on this page:

https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/59/taking-advantage-of-one-time-pad-key-reuse

and use the image_xor.py to create mandatory_1_task_2.gif and from the image it is easy
to discern the text Hello There and the image of a snow flake crsytal


So far I learned that it is bad to reuse the pad becuase it will make is possible to attack the
encrypted material if it is known that the same pad has been reused and if the type of the content
known then it will be possible to systematically work out a solution to decrypt the message as 
describe on page by the user Abijith Kp which has copied material from https://travisdazell.blogspot.com/2012/11/many-time-pad-attack-crib-drag.html
